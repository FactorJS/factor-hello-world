# Factor Hello World

This is a basic hello world example in a FactorJS app.

### Running The App

once you've cloned the repo, enter the folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd ./factor-hello-world
npm install
```

Now all that's needed to run the app is to use the following command:

```bash
npx factor dev
```

From there, just visit your browser and the default local url:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
